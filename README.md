  - Streamlit for UI
  - Langchain framework
  - Chromadb as a vector store
  - Few shot learning
- In the UI, store manager will ask questions in a natural language and it will produce the answers

## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to build a conversational chatbot using GooglePalm language model. It integrates with data sources to provide accurate and helpful responses to user queries.

## Features

- Integration with SQL databases for dynamic queries
- Customizable prompts and responses
- Semantic search using sentence embeddings

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/sultanbeishenkulov/Retail-LLM-Integration.git
    cd LLM_project
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Install additional dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install chromadb langchain huggingface-hub
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the main script to start the chatbot:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

2. Interact with the chatbot through the command line interface or integrate it into your application.

## Configuration

- I stored all my API key in JSON file (keys.json) as well as local MySQL credentials.
- Modify the `few_shots` list in `few_shots.py` to customize the prompts and responses for the chatbot.

## Examples

Here are some example interactions with the chatbot:

**Query:** How many white color Levi's t shirts we have available?
**Response:** 201

**Query:** If we have to sell all the Levis T-shirts today with discounts applied. How much revenue  our store will generate (post discounts)?
**Response:** 23643
